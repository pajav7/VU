Výzkumný úkol

Here are 3 programs created for my research assignment. Open-source programming language SageMath is used.

Programs implement the following algorithms:

Generating of the spectrum,
Finding of the size of the minimal alphabet enabling neighbour-free parallel addition,
Preprocessing for on-line division.

The fourth program which is discussed in my research assignment is included in the program for preprocessing as the function computeH.
